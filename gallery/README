Tips on adding entries to the gallery
 
* You can use the id in conjunction with specialized CSS.

* Most files don't have a lot of HTML, but some have tons. See
  independent-series for tips on adding a lot of HTML.

* You can also define a function called cleanup, which is the
  opposite of setup. It's perfect for stopping timers, for instance.

* Callbacks in HTML widgets. You might assume you can use
  <button onclick="func">
  and then define func in your run script:
  
  run: function() { function func() { .. }; }

  but because func is defined in function scope the button can't call it.
  The solution is to put func in the global scope, which is the same as window
  scope:

  run: function() { function window.func() { .. }; }

* You'll find it easier if you convert all the double-quotes in your HTML to
  single quotes.

TODOs:
  * Remove the awful tables in interaction.html (that I wrote)
  * Move all style to css
  * Add margin-left: 30px to #workarea, and then make #workarea h2 { margin-left: -30px}
  * Remove runtime warnings.
