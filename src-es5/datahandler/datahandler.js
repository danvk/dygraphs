 * @fileoverview This file contains the managment of data handlers
 * @author David Eberlein (david.eberlein@ch.sauter-bc.com)
 *
 * The idea is to define a common, generic data format that works for all data
 * structures supported by dygraphs. To make this possible, the DataHandler
 * interface is introduced. This makes it possible, that dygraph itself can work
 * with the same logic for every data type independent of the actual format and
 * the DataHandler takes care of the data format specific jobs.
 * DataHandlers are implemented for all data types supported by Dygraphs and
 * return Dygraphs compliant formats.
 * By default the correct DataHandler is chosen based on the options set.
 * Optionally the user may use his own DataHandler (similar to the plugin
 * system).
 *
 *
 * The unified data format returend by each handler is defined as so:
 * series[n][point] = [x,y,(extras)]
 *
 * This format contains the common basis that is needed to draw a simple line
 * series extended by optional extras for more complex graphing types. It
 * contains a primitive x value as first array entry, a primitive y value as
 * second array entry and an optional extras object for additional data needed.
 *
 * x must always be a number.
 * y must always be a number, NaN of type number or null.
 * extras is optional and must be interpreted by the DataHandler. It may be of
 * any type.
 *
 * In practice this might look something like this:
 * default: [x, yVal]
 * errorBar / customBar: [x, yVal, [yTopVariance, yBottomVariance] ]
 *
