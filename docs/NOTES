The dygraphs documentation uses server-side includes to enforce a consistent
template between pages. As such, you can't load the docs files directly in your
browser.

To iterate locally on the docs, run:

    cd (dygraphs)/docs
    ./ssi_server.py

Then visit localhost:8000 in your browser. You can edit/save/reload to see changes.

To push documentation to the web, run:

    cd (dygraphs)
    ./push-to-web.sh user@site.com:directory
