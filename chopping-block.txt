The dygraphs JS binary has ballooned by about 3x over the past three years.

Things to do to make dygraph-combine.js smaller:
- (4191) Move range selector out of core
- (2645) Simplify or eliminate dygraph-interaction-model.js.
- (1322) reduce duplication of names in Dygraph.isPixelChangingOptionList
- (????) Switch to Closure Compiler, which is more aggressive about dead code removal.
- (????) merge update, updateDeep, clone
- (????) can we kill the iterator stuff?
- (????) unify/simplify date processing code (dateString_, hmsString_, ...)
- (????) update YUI compressor (maybe it's gotten better?)
          -> ideally it would mangle internal method names & constants.
x (3942) Remove rgbcolor.js
x (1983) Remove stacktrace.js from dygraph-combined.js
x (1431) Remove srtftime, which is only minimally used.
x (????) Move symbols which shouldn't be exported out of Dygraph namespace.
          -> started w/ 141 exported symbols; down to ~80.
x (????) Unify Dygraph.prototype.log vs. Dygraph.log
x (????) Combined findPos{X,Y}, page{X,Y}
x (1321) move kberg's polygon stuff into a plugin

To measure size:
$ ./generate-combined.sh cat_minified | wc -c

To test correctness:
$ make test-combined

 135782 Initial (40827 gzipped)
 130557 removed stacktrace.js
 130142 removed stacktrace logic from combined
 129932 remove unused Dygraph.compareArrays_
 125996 remove strftime-min.js
 122403 replace rgbcolor.js with a DOM trick.
 122185 consolidate findPos{X,Y}
 120905 move custom circles into extras/circles.js
 115027 switch to uglifyjs
 113418 don't export ticker enum symbols.
 111327 more private symbols, consolidate on static log functions.
 110282 reduce exported symbols in dygraph-canvas.js
 109897 remove parseFloat_ from dygraph-layout.js
 109318 fewer exports from dygraph.js

135782 -> 109897 = 19% reduction
40827 -> 33214 gz = 18.6% reduction


TODO:
- remove all references to strftime-min.js
- check that window.getComputedStyle() returns 'rgb()' cross-browser.
    -> need to use document.defaultView.getComputedStyle for old FF
    -> need to use element.currentStyle[property] for old IE
- remove "jshint:globalstrict" where possible.
