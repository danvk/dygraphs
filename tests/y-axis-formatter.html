    <p>Original data with the default formatter <b>Dygraph.round_(y,2)</b> on Y axis.<br />
You can observe that this default formatter produces weird labels with values like 0.003...</p>
    <div id="normal" style="width:600px; height:300px;"></div>
    
    <p>Now we use the same data, but with a custom formatter <b>function(y) {return y.toExponential(1);}</b> on Y axis.
    <br />It's more readable!</p>
    <div id="exponential" style="width:600px; height:300px;"></div>
