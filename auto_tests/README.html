These tests are run with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/">
js-test-driver</a>. To use:

This is a specialized version of the instructions found at the js-test-driver
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/GettingStarted">
Getting Started</a> wiki. They're listed as a courtesy, but you really should
get to understand js-test-driver, which has lots of powerful features.

To run tests:
<ul>
  <li>Start a terminal window at the dygraphs root directory (one
    directory up from here.)</li>
  <li>From there, you start the test server and capture at least one slave
    browser.
    <ol>
      <li>Run <code>java -jar ./auto_tests/lib/JsTestDriver-1.3.2.jar --port
        9876</code></li>
      <li>Open <a href="http://localhost:9876/capture">
        http://localhost:9876/capture</a> in the browser you want to use for
      your test.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Run the tests with <code>java -jar ./auto_tests/lib/JsTestDriver-1.3.2.jar
      --tests all</code></li>
</ul>

This is a bit of a hack, but you can also run tests locally, and manually, by
using this <a href="./misc/local.html">testing page</a>. Please don't rely on it
as proof that your tests pass; the command-line is the reference for ensuring
Dygraphs automated tests pass.
