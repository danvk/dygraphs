These tests are run with js-test-driver
(http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/).

Running tests
-------------

- Start a terminal window at the dygraphs root directory (one
  directory up from here.)

- From there, you start the test server and capture at least one slave
  browser:

   Run:
   $ java -jar ./auto_tests/lib/JsTestDriver-1.3.3c.jar --port 9876
  
   Open
   http://localhost:9876/capture
   in the browser you want to use for your test.

- Run the tests with:

  $ java -jar ./auto_tests/lib/JsTestDriver-1.3.3c.jar --tests all


Debugging tests
---------------

This is a bit of a hack, but you can also run tests manually inside the browser
using auto_tests/misc/local.html.

Once you've opened that page, open up the JavaScript console and run something
like:

  new SimpleDrawingTestCase().runTest("testDrawSimpleRangePlusOne")

to run just one test. This is useful for seeing the dygraph that the test
creates, setting breakpoints, etc.

Please don't rely on it as proof that your tests pass; the command-line is the
reference for ensuring Dygraphs automated tests pass.

They're listed as a courtesy, but you really should get to understand
js-test-driver, which has lots of powerful features.)
